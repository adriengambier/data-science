# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing projects done for academic purpose or during free time. All projects are coded in Python and using iPython Notebooks for visualization. 

Links to the datasets are available in the notebooks where they are used in the case of Machine Learning Projects.

## Projects

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Medical Charges](https://github.com/adriengambier/data-science/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Data Visualization of the population and their medical charges. Prediction of the charges using linear regression to optimize R2 score.
